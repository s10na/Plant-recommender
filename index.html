 <!-- Select Fields -->
  <label for="slope">Field Slope:</label>
  <p class="input-info">
    The slope of a field influences how water and nutrients move across the land. Fields with steep slopes 
    (greater than 10%) have a higher risk of soil erosion and nutrient runoff, especially during heavy rainfall.
    Select the field slope within a 20-metre-wide strip along the watercourse or on the field edge that is closest to the nearest water body.<br><br>
    You can estimate slope using topographic maps, digital elevation models (DEM), online tools like 
    Google Earth, or GIS platforms (e.g. www.agraratlas.inspire.gv.at). Even smartphone apps can assist with on-site estimation.
  </p>
  <select id="slope">
    <option value="lt10">< 10 %</option>
    <option value="gt10">> 10 %</option>
  </select>
  
  
  <label for="fertilizer">Fertilizer Use:</label>
  <p class="input-info">
  Fertilizer use affects the amount of nitrogen and phosphorus that can be lost from fields into waterways. 
  Higher use increases the risk of nutrient runoff, especially without proper buffer zones. <br><br>
  You can estimate inorganic (chemical or mineral) fertilizer use based on your fertilization plan or farm records.<br><br>
  <strong>Fertilizer use categories:</strong><br>
  - <strong>Low</strong>: Less than <code>50 kg/ha</code> Nitrogen <em>and</em> less than <code>10 kg/ha</code> Phosphorus<br>
  - <strong>Moderate</strong>: Between <code>50–100 kg/ha</code> Nitrogen <em>or</em> <code>10–20 kg/ha</code> Phosphorus<br>
  - <strong>High</strong>: More than <code>100 kg/ha</code> Nitrogen <em>or</em> more than <code>20 kg/ha</code> Phosphorus
  </p>
  <select id="fertilizer">
    <option value="low">Low (&lt; 50 kg/ha N and &lt; 10 kg/ha P)</option>
    <option value="moderate">Moderate (50–100 kg/ha N or 10–20 kg/ha P)</option>
    <option value="high">High (&gt; 100 kg/ha N or &gt; 20 kg/ha P)</option>
  </select>

  <label for="soil">Soil Type:</label>
  <p class="input-info">
    Soil type influences water infiltration, erosion, and nutrient retention. For example, sandy soils drain quickly 
    but hold fewer nutrients, while clay soils retain water and nutrients longer but can erode easily.<br><br>
    You can determine your soil type using a soil survey, agricultural extension services, or by submitting a soil sample 
    to a lab. Online tools like SoilGrids or local GIS databases (e.g. https://bodenkarte.at) may also help.<br><br>
    Choose the dominant fraction in the topsoil — for example, if your soil is classified as sandy loam, select "Loam".
  </p>
  <select id="soil">
   <option value="sand">Sand</option>
    <option value="loam">Loam</option>
    <option value="clay">Clay</option>
  </select>

  <label for="rain">Annual Precipitation:</label>
  <p class="input-info">
    Annual precipitation affects surface runoff and erosion risk. Areas with higher rainfall require wider buffer strips 
    to manage water and nutrient flow. <br><br>
    • <strong>Dry:</strong> 0–699 mm/year<br>
    • <strong>Moderate:</strong> 700–1499 mm/year<br>
    • <strong>Heavy:</strong> 1500+ mm/year<br><br>
    You can find precipitation data from meteorological services, regional climate portals, or long-term farm records.
    For Austria, you can find a map with mean annual precipitation values on the WebGIS application eHYD (https://ehyd.gv.at/).
  </p>
  <select id="rain">
    <option value="Dry">Dry (0–699 mm/year)</option>

    <option value="Heavy">Heavy (>1500 mm/year)</option>
  </select>

  <label for="distance">Distance to Water Body:</label>
  <p class="input-info">
    The proximity of a field to rivers, lakes, or ditches influences how quickly runoff can enter water bodies. 
    Fields closer to water require stricter management to prevent pollution. <br><br>
    You can estimate distance using field maps, aerial imagery, GIS tools, or simply measure with a rangefinder or app.

  "Salix spp.": `<p>Salix spp. (Willow) are fast-growing shrub or tree species typically found in moist environments such as riparian zones, wetlands, and streambanks. Depending on the species, they can grow from 1.5–3 meters (shrubs) to over 15–20 meters tall (trees), with spreading root systems that can extend several meters both vertically and laterally. They are characterized by their high tolerance to waterlogging, ability to root easily from cuttings, and extensive fibrous roots that provide mechanical reinforcement to the soil. These traits make them particularly suitable for use in bioengineering, especially for soil stabilization, erosion control, and phytoremediation.</p>
<p>In buffer strips near agricultural fields, willows effectively absorb excess nutrients (notably nitrogen and phosphorus), slow down surface runoff, promote infiltration and sedimentation, and provide ecological habitat for birds and insects. Their rapid growth, low maintenance requirements, and high biomass production make them an economically and ecologically sustainable solution for protecting water bodies and restoring degraded riparian landscapes.</p>`,
